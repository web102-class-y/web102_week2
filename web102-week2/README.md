# Web Development Project 2 - *Cybersecurity Auditd Review*

Submitted by: **Haoyang Li**

This web app: **A flashcard study app for reviewing Linux `auditd` and host-based intrusion detection concepts. Each card shows a cybersecurity question on the front, and clicking flips it to reveal the answer, and the Next button shows a random card from the set.**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:


- [x] **The app displays the title of the card set, a short description, and the total number of cards**
  - [x] Title of card set is displayed 
  - [x] A short description of the card set is displayed 
  - [x] A list of card pairs is created
  - [x] The total number of cards in the set is displayed 
  - [x] Card set is represented as a list of card pairs (an array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the question and answer is perfectly fine)
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed**
  - [x] Only one half of the information pair is displayed at a time
- [x] **Clicking on the card flips the card over, showing the corresponding component of the information pair**
  - [x] Clicking on a card flips it over, showing the back with corresponding information 
  - [x] Clicking on a flipped card again flips it back, showing the front
- [x] **Clicking on the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text
  - [ ] Some or all cards have images in place of or in addition to text
- [ ] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - Example categories you can use:
    - Difficulty: Easy/medium/hard
    - Subject: Biology/Chemistry/Physics/Earth science

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] A **Back button** with card history — previously seen cards are stored in a history list, so the user can navigate back to review earlier cards.
* [x] Buttons are **disabled** at the appropriate times (Back is disabled when there is no earlier card; Next is disabled once every card has been drawn from the bank).
* [x] Drawn cards are removed from the question bank, so the same card is never shown twice until the set is exhausted.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Learned that calling a state-setting function during render causes an infinite re-render loop in React; state must be updated from event handlers or initialized lazily instead.
- Building the CSS 3D flip effect required `perspective`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and `backface-visibility: hidden` working together.
